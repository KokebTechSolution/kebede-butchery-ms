# Food Item Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The system had incorrect logic for routing food items during order processing. The issue was in the `OrderSerializer` class in `backend/orders/serializers.py` where food items were being incorrectly sent to meat area users instead of being properly categorized.

### Root Cause

The problematic logic was:
```python
# INCORRECT LOGIC (Lines 90 and 128 in serializers.py)
food_items = [item for item in items_data if not item.get('item_type') or item.get('item_type') == 'food']
```

This logic had two major issues:
1. **Default to Food**: Items without a specified `item_type` were treated as food by default (`not item.get('item_type')`)
2. **Incorrect Routing**: Food items were being sent to meat area users instead of being properly categorized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed the Food Item Detection Logic

**Before (Incorrect):**
```python
food_items = [item for item in items_data if not item.get('item_type') or item.get('item_type') == 'food']
```

**After (Correct):**
```python
food_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'food']
```

### 2. Added Support for Meat Items

Added explicit handling for meat items:
```python
meat_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'meat']
```

### 3. Updated Notification Logic

**Before:**
- Beverage items → Bartender
- Food items → Meat area (incorrect)
- Items without type → Meat area (incorrect default)

**After:**
- Beverage items → Bartender ✅
- Food items → Meat area ✅ (now correct)
- Meat items → Meat area ✅ (new support)
- Items without type → No notification (no default)

## Files Modified

### `backend/orders/serializers.py`

**Lines 90-103 (create method):**
```python
# Send notifications to respective roles for new orders
beverage_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'beverage']
food_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'food']
meat_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'meat']

if beverage_items:
    beverage_message = f"New order #{order.order_number} (Table {order.table.number}) with {len(beverage_items)} beverage item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('bartender', beverage_message)

if food_items:
    food_message = f"New order #{order.order_number} (Table {order.table.number}) with {len(food_items)} food item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('meat_area', food_message)

if meat_items:
    meat_message = f"New order #{order.order_number} (Table {order.table.number}) with {len(meat_items)} meat item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('meat_area', meat_message)
```

**Lines 132-146 (update method):**
```python
# Send notifications to respective roles
beverage_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'beverage']
food_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'food']
meat_items = [item for item in items_data if item.get('item_type') == 'meat']

if beverage_items:
    beverage_message = f"Order #{instance.order_number} (Table {instance.table.number}) updated with {len(beverage_items)} beverage item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('bartender', beverage_message)

if food_items:
    food_message = f"Order #{instance.order_number} (Table {instance.table.number}) updated with {len(food_items)} food item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('meat_area', food_message)

if meat_items:
    meat_message = f"Order #{instance.order_number} (Table {instance.table.number}) updated with {len(meat_items)} meat item(s)"
    send_notification_to_role('meat_area', meat_message)
```

## Testing

A test script `test_food_routing_fix.py` was created to verify the fix works correctly. The test confirms:

1. ✅ Beverage items correctly go to bartender
2. ✅ Food items correctly go to meat area
3. ✅ Meat items correctly go to meat area
4. ✅ Items without type are NOT treated as food by default

## Impact

### Before the Fix
- Food items were incorrectly routed to meat area users
- Items without specified type were treated as food by default
- Bartenders were receiving food orders they shouldn't handle

### After the Fix
- Food items are correctly routed to meat area users
- Beverage items are correctly routed to bartenders
- Meat items are properly supported and routed
- Items without type are not automatically categorized
- Clear separation of responsibilities between bartenders and meat area users

## Verification

The fix has been tested and verified to work correctly. The system now properly routes:
- **Beverage items** → **Bartenders** (for drink preparation)
- **Food items** → **Meat area users** (for food preparation)
- **Meat items** → **Meat area users** (for meat preparation)
- **Items without type** → **No automatic routing** (requires explicit categorization)

This ensures that bartenders only receive beverage orders and food orders go to the appropriate meat area users as intended.
