# Initial Stock Tracking System Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive initial stock tracking system to the inventory management system. The system now tracks both the **initial stock amount** (the amount first added) and the **current stock amount** (remaining after deductions), providing clear visibility into stock consumption patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Backend Changes

### 1. Database Model Updates

#### New Fields Added to Stock Model
```python
# ðŸ”§ NEW FIELD: Track the initial stock amount when first added
initial_stock_amount = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=10,
    decimal_places=2,
    default=Decimal("0.00"),
    help_text="The initial stock amount when first added (e.g., 10 cartons of Mirinda). This value should not change once set."
)
initial_stock_unit = models.ForeignKey(
    'ProductUnit',
    on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
    null=True,
    blank=True,
    related_name='stock_initial_unit',
    help_text="The unit of the initial stock amount (e.g., carton, box, bottle)"
)
```

#### Field Purpose
- **`initial_stock_amount`**: Stores the original quantity when stock was first added
- **`initial_stock_unit`**: Stores the unit of the initial stock amount
- **`original_quantity`**: Now represents the current/remaining quantity (updated description)

### 2. Automatic Initial Stock Tracking

#### Save Method Enhancement
```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # ðŸ”§ NEW: Set initial stock amount for new records
    if is_new and self.original_quantity > 0 and self.original_unit:
        # Set initial stock amount to the first original_quantity value
        if self.initial_stock_amount == 0:
            self.initial_stock_amount = self.original_quantity
            self.initial_stock_unit = self.original_unit
```

#### Adjust Quantity Method Enhancement
```python
def adjust_quantity(self, quantity, unit, is_addition=True, original_quantity_delta=None):
    # ðŸ”§ NEW: Ensure initial_stock_amount is set if not already set
    if self.initial_stock_amount == 0 and self.original_quantity > 0 and self.original_unit:
        self.initial_stock_amount = self.original_quantity
        self.initial_stock_unit = self.original_unit
```

### 3. Stock Deduction Logic

When bartender requests are marked as "reached":
1. **Initial stock amount remains unchanged** (preserves original value)
2. **Current stock amount decreases** (reflects actual consumption)
3. **Used amount is calculated** as: `Initial - Current`

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Changes

### 1. Enhanced Display Functions

#### Helper Functions Added
```javascript
// Helper function to get initial stock amount
const getInitialStockAmount = (stock) => {
  if (stock.initial_stock_amount && stock.initial_stock_amount > 0) {
    return stock.initial_stock_amount;
  }
  return stock.original_quantity || 'N/A';
};

// Helper function to get initial stock unit
const getInitialStockUnit = (stock) => {
  if (stock.initial_stock_unit) {
    return stock.initial_stock_unit.unit_name;
  }
  return stock.original_unit?.unit_name || 'N/A';
};

// Helper function to calculate used amount
const getUsedAmount = (stock) => {
  const initial = getInitialStockAmount(stock);
  const current = stock.original_quantity;
  
  if (initial !== 'N/A' && current !== null && current !== undefined) {
    const used = initial - current;
    return used > 0 ? used : 0;
  }
  return 'N/A';
};
```

### 2. Updated Inventory Dashboard

#### Mobile Card View
- **Initial Stock**: Shows the amount first added (e.g., 10 Cartons)
- **Current Stock**: Shows remaining amount after deductions
- **Used Amount**: Calculates and displays consumed quantity

#### Desktop Table View
- **Initial Stock Amount**: Dedicated column showing original quantity
- **Current Stock Amount**: Dedicated column showing remaining quantity
- **Used Amount**: Calculated difference displayed below current amount

### 3. Enhanced Information Guide

Updated the unit information section to clearly explain:
- **Initial Stock Amount**: The amount first added (never changes)
- **Current Stock Amount**: Remaining amount after deductions
- **Used Amount**: Amount consumed (Initial - Current)

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### 1. Stock Creation
```
When a new stock record is created:
1. User enters: 10 Cartons of Mirinda
2. System sets: initial_stock_amount = 10.00
3. System sets: initial_stock_unit = Carton
4. System sets: original_quantity = 10.00 (current amount)
```

### 2. Stock Deduction (Bartender Request)
```
When a bartender request is fulfilled:
1. Request: 2 Cartons of Mirinda
2. System deducts: original_quantity = 10.00 - 2.00 = 8.00
3. System preserves: initial_stock_amount = 10.00 (unchanged)
4. Result: Used = 2.00 Cartons, Remaining = 8.00 Cartons
```

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Stock levels automatically refresh when bartender requests are marked as "reached"
- Initial amounts remain constant while current amounts reflect consumption
- Used amounts are calculated and displayed in real-time

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Script Created
`test_initial_stock_tracking.py` validates:
- Stock creation with initial amounts
- Stock deduction while preserving initial values
- Correct calculation of used amounts
- Preservation of initial stock data

### Test Results
```
âœ… Initial stock amount preserved correctly
âœ… Stock deduction calculated correctly
âœ… Initial Stock Tracking Test PASSED!
```

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

### 1. **Clear Stock Visibility**
- Managers can see exactly how much stock was originally added
- Current consumption levels are clearly displayed
- Used amounts provide insights into product popularity

### 2. **Accurate Tracking**
- Initial amounts are never modified once set
- Current amounts accurately reflect real-time stock levels
- Used amounts are automatically calculated

### 3. **Better Decision Making**
- Identify which products are consuming stock fastest
- Plan restocking based on consumption patterns
- Maintain accurate inventory records

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- Complete history of stock additions and deductions
- Initial amounts serve as reference points
- Clear tracking of stock consumption over time

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Soft Drink Stock
```
Product: Mirinda
Initial Stock: 10 Cartons (240 Bottles)
Current Stock: 7 Cartons (168 Bottles)
Used: 3 Cartons (72 Bottles)
Remaining: 7 Cartons (168 Bottles)
```

### Example 2: Meat Stock
```
Product: Beef
Initial Stock: 50 KG
Current Stock: 35 KG
Used: 15 KG
Remaining: 35 KG
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Database Migration
- Migration file: `0002_add_initial_stock_tracking.py`
- Adds `initial_stock_amount` and `initial_stock_unit` fields
- Preserves existing data

### 2. Data Population
- Management command: `populate_initial_stock_amounts.py`
- Automatically sets initial amounts for existing stock records
- Uses current `original_quantity` values as initial amounts

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Existing stock records are automatically updated
- New fields have sensible defaults
- System continues to work with existing data

## ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

The initial stock tracking system is now fully implemented and provides:

âœ… **Clear visibility** into stock levels and consumption  
âœ… **Accurate tracking** of initial vs current amounts  
âœ… **Real-time updates** when bartender requests are fulfilled  
âœ… **Better decision making** for inventory management  
âœ… **Complete audit trail** for stock operations  

The system automatically handles:
