# Camera Payment Receipt Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds camera functionality to capture payment receipts when online payment is selected during order placement. The system now requires receipt capture for online payments and prevents new orders on tables that are currently processing orders.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Camera Capture Component (`CameraCapture`)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/CameraCapture/`
- **Features**:
  - Access device camera (preferably back camera)
  - Capture high-quality images (1280x720)
  - Preview captured image with retake option
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - Error handling for camera permissions

### 2. Enhanced Payment Method Modal (`PaymentMethodModal`)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/PaymentMethodModal.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Payment method selection (Cash/Online)
  - Camera integration for online payments
  - Receipt preview and management
  - Validation to ensure receipt capture for online payments

### 3. Updated Cart Component (`Cart`)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/Cart/Cart.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Integration with PaymentMethodModal
  - Table status awareness
  - Prevents new orders on tables with active orders
  - Shows appropriate UI based on table status

### 4. Backend Updates

#### Order Model (`backend/orders/models.py`)
- Added `receipt_image` field for storing payment receipts
- Field: `ImageField(upload_to='receipts/', null=True, blank=True)`

#### Order Serializer (`backend/orders/serializers.py`)
- Added `receipt_image` field to serializer
- Handles file uploads properly

#### Order Views (`backend/orders/views.py`)
- Updated `perform_create` method to handle receipt images
- Supports both JSON and FormData requests
- Handles payment options

### 5. Table Status Logic
- Tables with status "ordering" cannot accept new orders
- Users can only view/edit existing orders on such tables
- Clear UI indicators show table status and available actions

## How It Works

### 1. Order Placement Flow
1. User adds items to cart
2. Clicks "Place Order"
3. Payment method selection modal appears
4. If "Online" is selected:
   - Camera opens automatically
   - User captures payment receipt
   - Receipt is previewed and can be retaken
5. Order is placed with payment method and receipt (if applicable)

### 2. Table Status Management
- **Available**: Can place new orders
- **Ordering**: Cannot place new orders, can only view/edit existing
- **Ready to Pay**: Order complete, waiting for payment
- **Occupied**: Order in progress

### 3. Receipt Storage
- Receipt images are stored in `backend/media/receipts/`
- Images are associated with orders via the `receipt_image` field
- Supports JPEG format with compression

## Technical Details

### Frontend Dependencies
- Uses native `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API
- No additional packages required
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Backend Dependencies
- Django with Pillow for image handling
- File upload support via FormData
- JSON parsing for complex data structures

### Security Features
- Camera permission handling
- File type validation
- User authentication required

## Usage Instructions

### For Waiters
1. **New Order**: Select available table → Add items → Place Order → Select payment method
2. **Online Payment**: Select "Online" → Camera opens → Capture receipt → Confirm
3. **Existing Order**: Click on "ordering" table → View order details → Edit/add items

### For Customers
- Cash payments: Pay at counter
- Online payments: Show payment receipt to waiter for verification

## Error Handling

### Camera Issues
- Permission denied: Shows retry button with instructions
- Device not supported: Graceful fallback message
- Network issues: Retry mechanism

### Payment Issues
- Missing receipt for online payment: Prevents order placement
- Invalid payment method: Validation error
- File upload failures: Error message with retry option

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **OCR Integration**: Extract text from receipts automatically
2. **Payment Verification**: API integration with payment providers
3. **Receipt Management**: View/edit/delete receipt images
4. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple receipts
5. **Cloud Storage**: Store receipts in cloud for backup

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Image Compression**: Reduce file sizes before upload
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load receipt images on demand
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed receipts
4. **CDN**: Serve images from content delivery network

## Testing

### Frontend Testing
- Test camera access on different devices
- Verify payment method selection
- Test table status logic
- Validate responsive design

### Backend Testing
- Test file upload functionality
- Verify order creation with receipts
- Test payment option handling
- Validate database operations

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- Ensure `media/` directory is writable
- Configure proper file upload limits
- Set up image processing if needed
- Test camera permissions on target devices

### Environment Variables
- `MEDIA_ROOT`: Directory for file uploads
- `MEDIA_URL`: URL prefix for media files
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`: Maximum file size limit

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **Receipt not saving**: Verify file upload configuration
3. **Payment method error**: Check order data validation
4. **Table status issues**: Verify table model updates

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Review Django logs for backend issues
- Verify database migrations are applied
- Test camera access in browser settings

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for capturing payment receipts during online payment processing while maintaining the existing order management functionality. The system ensures data integrity and provides a smooth user experience for both waiters and customers.
